# Project Loan Approval Prediction 🏦 💰

## The Team : Lucie, Manuel, Joel, Johana 👓


## Project Overview 📑
W are developing a machine learning model to predict whether a loan will be approved or rejected based on various features of the applicants. 
This prediction helps the bank make informed lending decisions.

## Dataset 
### Data Cleaning: 
Removed leading and trailing spaces from both column names and data entries.

### Feature Engineering: 
Created a new column (Total_Asset_Value) as the sum of various asset columns.

### Encoding: 
Categorical variables: (like education and self_employed) were converted into dummy variables using one-hot encoding.
Normalization/Standardization: The dataset was normalized and standardized to see which method yielded better accuracy.
Loan_id removed because it's non-relevant for modeling
